## How it works

This project based on template matching algorithm
1. You need a target picture, we call this picture was template picture.
2. In this case I use opencv to interact with my emulator.
3. Using template matching algorithm I detect the coordinate of my template picture with the opencv image.
4. After getting the coordinate, I manage things I want like click and dragging.
5. Setting the algorithm flow so it doesn't crash
